appengine-endpoints-tictactoe-ios
================================

This application implements a simple client for a Tic Tac Toe game using
Google Cloud Endpoints, App Engine, Objective-C, and iOS.

It relies on a copy of the [Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C][1].

This example also uses ARC. If your application uses ARC, you must set the
-fno-objc-arc for the files included in the client library. To do this, in
Project Navigator -> Target -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources, set the
-fno-objc-arc compiler flag for each of the client library sources.
